        **There are two NCCL versions in a container and they routinely
        differ**, so neither is reported under a bare ``nccl``. ``torch.cuda
        .nccl.version()`` is the version torch was *compiled against* — its
        bundled ``nvidia-nccl-cu*`` wheel — while an engine's own communicator
        (vLLM's ``pynccl``) ``dlopen``s ``libnccl.so.2`` through the dynamic
        loader and gets whatever the image installed system-wide. Observed on
        the eugr b12x nightly: torch says 2.29.7, the loaded library is 2.31.2,
        and 2.31.2 is what performs every all-reduce in the workload.

        Reporting only torch's answer named the one library that is *not* doing
        the work — in job metadata and in the benchmark artifact, where the NCCL
        version is exactly what a collective hang or an all-reduce regression
        gets investigated against. So both are reported under names that say
        which is which, and the compiled-vs-loaded gap becomes visible instead
        of being silently resolved in favour of the wrong one.

        Both are normalized to dotted strings so they are comparable to each
        other and to what engines print; ``nccl`` previously emitted a Python
        tuple repr (``(2, 29, 7)``).
