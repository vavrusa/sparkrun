      ``source_registry`` *and* not fetched from a URL);

    Recipes fetched from a remote URL (``recipe.is_url_sourced``) are
    **never** auto-trusted, even though they carry no ``source_registry``:
    a "run this link" recipe must not silently execute its hooks. They

    Trust is a **local** decision: it lives in the user's

    repository cannot grant itself trust; the user must opt in either via
    the bootstrap defaults (registries shipped as ``trusted=True`` in

#:
#: This was an ungated resource knob while ``host`` was the default, when

    A structured runtime renders its serve command by iterating a flag map,

    engine then falls back to its own default, which is exactly what a
    recipe pinning ``lm_head_dtype: bf16`` for correctness was trying to
    prevent (issue #276; ``--disable-tool-grammar`` in #221 was the same
    gap).  Nothing about the resulting deployment looks wrong.

    A key counts as reaching something when it is any of:

    * listed in :meth:`~sparkrun.runtimes.base.RuntimePlugin.known_config_keys`
      (the runtime's flag map plus whatever it consumes outside it),

    each one twice).  Empty when the runtime does
    not declare ``known_config_keys`` — silence is the safe default for a
    runtime whose consumed-key set has not been established.

    Warns rather than raises deliberately: recipes are fetched from
    registries that version independently of sparkrun, so a key this build
    doesn't know is routinely a *newer* recipe rather than a broken one,
    and hard-failing would strand a user between two published artifacts.

    """Launch an inference workload.

    This is the shared pipeline used by ``run``, ``benchmark``, and
    ``proxy load``.  It handles:

    1. Job metadata persistence
    2. Builder phase (if recipe defines a builder)
    3. Runtime preparation
    4. Resource distribution (container image + model)
    5. Tuning config sync and distribution
    6. GGUF model resolution
    7. Serve command generation
    8. Page cache clear
    9. ``runtime.run()``

    Args:
        recipe: Loaded and validated recipe.
        runtime: Resolved runtime plugin.
        host_list: Resolved and trimmed host list.
        overrides: Merged overrides dict (from recipe_override_options + extras).
        config: SparkrunConfig instance; required unless sctx supplies one.
        v: SAF Variables instance (optional, uses singleton if None).
        is_solo: Whether to launch in solo mode.
        cache_dir: Remote/cluster cache dir (None = resolve from config).
        local_cache_dir: Control-machine cache dir for downloads (None = same as cache_dir).
        transfer_mode: Resource transfer mode override (None = "auto").
        transfer_interface: Network interface for transfers (cx7 or mgmt; None = cx7 default).
        recipe_ref: Simplified recipe reference for display (e.g. @spark-arena/UUID).
        registry_mgr: Optional registry manager; registry tuning sync is skipped when absent.
        auto_port: If True, auto-increment port when the desired port is in use.
        sync_tuning: Whether to sync tuning configs from registries.
        dry_run: Show what would be done without executing.
        detached: Run containers in detached mode.
        follow: whether to follow logs
        ray_port: Ray GCS port (forwarded to runtime.run).
        dashboard_port: Ray dashboard port (forwarded to runtime.run).
        dashboard: Tri-state Ray dashboard toggle, forwarded verbatim to
            runtime.run. ``True``/``False`` force it; ``None`` lets the Ray
            runtime resolve it against ``recipe.runtime_config.dashboard``
            (defaulting on).
        init_port: Distributed init port (forwarded to runtime.run).
        executor_config: Executor config
        rootless: Run containers in rootless mode (applies defaults to executor_config)
        auto_user: Automatically set user and group IDs to match host. (applies defaults to executor_config)


    Returns:
        LaunchResult with the outcome and all resolved context.

    ``launch_inference(detached=True)`` returns once the *containers* are
    up, which for a large model is minutes before the server accepts a
    request.  Callers that need to act on a serving endpoint must wait
    for it explicitly.

    Two stages, and the order matters: an inference server refuses
    connections outright until its engine has finished initializing, so
    the entire startup is indistinguishable from a crash when probing
    the URL alone.  :func:`wait_for_port` polls the head *host* for a
    listening socket and aborts early if the head container has exited;
    only then is :func:`wait_for_healthy`'s connection-refused-means-dead
    heuristic sound.

    This is the field-based form, callable when there is no
    :class:`LaunchResult` — a workload found already serving by ``--ensure``
    still has to be waited on, and it never produced one.

    Args:
        runtime: Runtime plugin, asked for the head container name.
        cluster_id: Cluster id of the workload.
        host_list: Hosts the workload runs on; the first is the head.
        is_solo: Whether the workload launched in solo mode.
        port: Inference HTTP port on the head.
        ssh_kwargs: SSH parameters for probing the head host.
        dry_run: Report ready without waiting.
        port_timeout_s: Wall-clock budget for the port stage
            (:data:`DEFAULT_PORT_READY_TIMEOUT_S`). ``math.inf`` polls
            until cancelled.
        port_retry_interval: Seconds between port polls.
        health_timeout_s: Wall-clock budget for the health stage
            (:data:`DEFAULT_HEALTH_READY_TIMEOUT_S`).
        health_retry_interval: Seconds between health polls.
        timeline: Span collector for the two waits.  Pass the launch's own so
            the readiness spans join its phases in one artifact.
        cancel: Set to abandon the wait.  Yields ``reason="cancelled"`` and
            leaves the in-flight span *open*, so a rendered timeline shows
            "did not finish" rather than claiming a stage failed.
        parent: Span to record the two stages under.  ``None`` inherits from
            the timeline's open-span stack, which is what nests them inside
            phase 6 when ``post_launch_lifecycle`` is the caller.  A caller
            running this **off the main thread** must not inherit — pass a
            span id or :data:`~sparkrun.core.timing.ROOT`.

    *on_ready*, which is called **on the watcher thread** while another
    process is writing to the same terminal.  A callback must therefore
    emit a single short line in one write; anything multi-line belongs in
    the caller's finalize step, after the stream has stopped.

    Console-free by construction — the callback supplies all presentation.

    On success it also opens a ``serve.serving`` span, closed by
    :meth:`stop`.  Without it the tree stops accounting at the moment the
    endpoint answered while the total kept running, so a launch watched for
    two hours showed ~775s of rows under a 7695s total.  It is *measured*
    (endpoint answered → we stopped watching) rather than derived from that
    gap, which is what lets it reach the diagnostics record and keeps the
    formatter free of a synthesized row that no artifact contains.

    Not reusable: one watcher per launch, started once.

        10s (container liveness, with ``ConnectTimeout=10`` under it).  A
        join shorter than that abandons the thread — with a live ``ssh``
        child — in precisely the case worth waiting for: a log stream that
        ended on its own means the container exited, and the probe about to
        return is what would say so.

        A longer join costs nothing on Ctrl-C.  The probe runs in this
        process group, so SIGINT reaches the ``ssh`` child too and the
        in-flight probe dies with it; the loop then sees the cancel at the
        top of its next iteration.

        that somehow misses both must not hold up the exit.
